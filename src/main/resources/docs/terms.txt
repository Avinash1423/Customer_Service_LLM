• If it’s past the due date, a complaint is filed, and a CS agent is notified.

• A reference number is issued and stored in the issue reference table. The agent will review the
issue and contact the customer.

• If excess payment is detected, a refund is issued.
• If not, the sender is informed that the charge is correct.

5. System Processes & Rules
5.1 Order Creation
• At the time of pickup, the agent enters all parcel and customer details into the Order Database.
• If the customer is unregistered, they are first registered (this process is outside current system
scope).
5.2 Sorting Center
• The parcel undergoes a compliance check.
• Proper packing is verified.
• Charges are calculated based on weight and distance.
• This is when an entry is made in the Charge Database.
5.3 Distribution Center
• The parcel is sent to the nearest distribution point.
• Parcels can still be changed or cancelled at this stage, but with additional fees.
6. Fees & Payment Rules
• Charge Calculation:
o Base charge = (20 * weight in kg) + (30 * distance in km)
o Additional fees may apply for changes (see Section 4.6–4.8).
• Payment Policy:
o Once the parcel reaches the sorting stage, payment is required before further processing.
o Only after payment is received will the order status be updated.
o Overpaid amounts are refunded (if verified).
o Underpaid orders will remain on hold until full payment is received.
• Additional Fees Database:
o Tracks extra charges applied for changes (e.g., receiver change, cancellation).
o Example reasons include “Change at sorting” or “Change at distribution”.
• Refund Database:
o Stores refund transactions and their associated reasons.
7. Additional Notes
• At the sorting stage, a parcel may be denied due to policy violations. These are returned to the
sender, and standard charges still apply.
• All complaints are logged with parcel ID, timestamp, and action taken.
• Payment records are updated upon successful transactions; logic for live payment processing is
outside the scope of this service description.
